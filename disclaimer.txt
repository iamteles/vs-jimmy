Hi! 
I am crunchyng, the director and lead artist for YLYL Funkin
I know this mod took a while and you may think after you finish the mod: "This was Underwhelming", or "This was dissapointing"
I understand completely but please understand this is a demo and the first version. The mod will be way better in v2 and when we
add more songs in freeplay.
Week 1 was just a first update to add jimmy to the mod. 
We have a lot planned for future versions.

Thank you for being patient and please support everyone on the team.
